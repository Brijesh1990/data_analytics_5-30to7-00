# What is Data?

## Definition

**Data** is a collection of facts, figures, statistics, or information that can be measured, observed, and analyzed. In the context of data analytics, data represents raw observations or measurements from the real world that can be processed, analyzed, and interpreted to extract meaningful insights and support decision-making.

Data is the foundation of analytics - it's the raw material that, when organized and analyzed, becomes information and eventually knowledge.

## Types of Data in Data Analytics

### 1. **Structured Data**

- **Definition**: Data organized in a fixed format with defined fields and records
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Organized in rows and columns (tabular format)
  - Easy to search and analyze
  - Stored in databases and spreadsheets
- **Examples**:
  - Relational databases (SQL databases)
  - Excel spreadsheets
  - CSV files
  - Data tables with defined schemas

### 2. **Unstructured Data**
- **Definition**: Data that lacks a predefined format or organization
- **Characteristics**:
  - No fixed structure
  - Difficult to process and analyze traditionally
  - Requires specialized tools for analysis
- **Examples**:
  - Text documents and emails
  - Images and videos
  - Audio files
  - Social media posts
  - PDF documents
  - Web pages and blog content

### 3. **Semi-Structured Data**
- **Definition**: Data that has some organizational properties but is not fully structured
- **Characteristics**:
  - Contains tags or metadata that organize information
  - More flexible than structured data
  - Easier to analyze than unstructured data
- **Examples**:
  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files
  - XML (eXtensible Markup Language) documents
  - HTML pages
  - Log files
  - NoSQL databases (MongoDB, CouchDB)

## Data Types by Nature

### **Quantitative Data (Numerical)**
- **Definition**: Data expressed in numbers and quantities
- **Subtypes**:
  - **Discrete Data**: Countable, whole numbers (e.g., number of customers, products sold)
  - **Continuous Data**: Measurable on a scale with infinite possibilities (e.g., temperature, height, weight, sales revenue)

### **Qualitative Data (Categorical)**
- **Definition**: Data describing qualities or characteristics
- **Subtypes**:
  - **Nominal Data**: Categories with no natural order (e.g., colors, gender, country, product type)
  - **Ordinal Data**: Categories with a natural order or ranking (e.g., customer satisfaction levels: poor, fair, good, excellent)

## Data Types by Time Dimension

### **Real-Time Data**
- Data generated and processed instantly
- Examples: Live social media feeds, stock market prices, sensor data

### **Historical Data**
- Data collected from the past
- Examples: Sales records, customer history, archived transactions

### **Time-Series Data**
- Data points indexed in time order
- Examples: Stock prices over time, monthly sales figures, temperature readings

## Data Types by Source

### **Primary Data**
- Collected directly from the source
- Examples: Surveys, interviews, experiments, observations

### **Secondary Data**
- Collected and published by other sources
- Examples: Government reports, research papers, public databases, published statistics

---

## Data Types by Volume

### **Big Data**
- **Definition**: Large volumes of data that traditional systems struggle to process
- Characteristics: Volume, Velocity, Variety (3 V's)
- Examples: Social media data, sensor networks, enterprise data

### **Small Data**
- Limited volume of data
- Examples: Small business transactions, departmental records

## Key Characteristics of Good Data (RABS)

1. **Relevant**: Pertinent to the business question or problem
2. **Accurate**: Correct and free from errors
3. **Balanced**: Sufficient sample size and representation
4. **Sufficient**: Enough data to draw meaningful conclusions
