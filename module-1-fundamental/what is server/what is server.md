# What is a Server? - Definition & Types

## Definition

A **server** is a computer or system that provides resources, services, data, or functionality to other computers (called clients) over a network. Servers respond to requests from clients and manage centralized resources like files, databases, applications, or processing power.

### Key Characteristics:
- Runs server software/applications
- Listens for client requests on specific ports
- Processes requests and sends responses
- Available 24/7 (ideally)
- More powerful hardware than typical client machines
- Manages and stores data/resources centrally

## Types of Servers

### 1. **Web Server**
- Delivers web pages and content to clients via HTTP/HTTPS
- Examples: Apache, Nginx, IIS, Node.js
- Stores HTML, CSS, JavaScript files

### 2. **Database Server**
- Stores and manages databases
- Processes queries and transactions
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB

### 3. **Mail Server**
- Handles email sending, receiving, and storage
- Protocols: SMTP (sending), IMAP/POP3 (retrieving)
- Examples: Microsoft Exchange, Gmail servers, Postfix

### 4. **File Server**
- Centralized storage and file sharing
- Controls file access and permissions
- Examples: Windows File Server, NFS (Network File System)

### 5. **Application Server**
- Runs business logic and applications
- Processes complex requests from clients
- Examples: Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere, Node.js

### 6. **DNS Server**
- Translates domain names to IP addresses
- Maintains DNS records
- Examples: BIND, Cloudflare DNS

### 7. **FTP Server**
- File transfer protocol server
- Enables file upload/download
- Examples: vsftpd, FileZilla Server

### 8. **Proxy Server**
- Intermediary between clients and servers
- Caches content, filters requests, provides security
- Examples: Squid, Nginx (as reverse proxy)

### 9. **Print Server**
- Manages printers and print jobs
- Routes print requests from multiple users
- Examples: Windows Print Server, CUPS

### 10. **Game Server**
- Hosts multiplayer games
- Manages player interactions and game state
- Examples: Valve servers, custom game servers

### 11. **VPN Server**
- Creates secure, encrypted connections
- Allows remote access to networks
- Examples: OpenVPN, WireGuard

### 12. **Chat/Messaging Server**
- Manages real-time communication
- Stores and routes messages
- Examples: Slack, Discord, XMPP servers

### 13. **Streaming Server**
- Delivers audio/video content
- Uses protocols: RTMP, HLS, DASH
- Examples: Wowza, Adobe Media Server

### 14. **Authentication/Authorization Server**
- Manages user credentials and permissions
- OAuth, LDAP, Active Directory servers
- Examples: Okta, Microsoft Active Directory

### 15. **API Server**
- Exposes application functionality via APIs
- RESTful or GraphQL endpoints
- Examples: Custom APIs, Firebase

### 16. **Load Balancer Server**
- Distributes traffic across multiple servers
- Improves performance and reliability
- Examples: HAProxy, Nginx, AWS Elastic Load Balancer

### 17. **Cache Server**
- Stores frequently accessed data
- Reduces database load and improves response time
- Examples: Redis, Memcached

### 18. **DHCP Server**
- Assigns IP addresses to devices on a network
- Examples: Windows DHCP, ISC DHCP

### 19. **Time Server (NTP)**
- Provides accurate time synchronization
- Examples: NTP servers, atomic clocks

### 20. **Backup/Archive Server**
- Stores backup copies of data
- Disaster recovery purposes
- Examples: Backup Exec, Veeam

### 21. **Telemetry/Monitoring Server**
- Collects system metrics and logs
- Performance monitoring
- Examples: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

### 22. **Git Server**
- Hosts version control repositories
- Examples: GitHub, GitLab, Gitea

### 23. **Container Registry Server**
- Stores Docker images and containers
- Examples: Docker Hub, Amazon ECR

### 24. **IoT Server**
- Manages Internet of Things devices
- Collects sensor data
- Examples: Azure IoT Hub, AWS IoT Core

## Server Architecture Models

### **Client-Server Model**
- Centralized server serves multiple clients
- Clients request services, servers provide them

### **Distributed Architecture**
- Multiple servers working together
- Load sharing and redundancy

### **Cloud Server**
- Virtual server hosted on cloud platforms
- Examples: AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Google Cloud

## Summary

Servers are essential infrastructure components that provide centralized services and resources. They range from simple web servers to complex database and application servers, each designed for specific purposes in modern networked environments.
