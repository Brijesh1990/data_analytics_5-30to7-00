# What is Statistics? - Definition & Types

## Definition

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It involves using mathematical and computational methods to transform raw data into meaningful insights that support decision-making and draw conclusions about populations based on samples.

### Key Characteristics:
- Data-driven approach to understanding phenomena
- Uses probability theory and mathematical techniques
- Helps identify patterns, trends, and relationships
- Reduces uncertainty in decision-making
- Applies to almost every field of study and business

## Main Branches of Statistics

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics**
- Summarizes and describes data characteristics
- Focuses on data that has already been collected
- Does not make predictions or inferences
- Uses measures: mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation
- Tools: charts, graphs, tables, frequency distributions

### 2. **Inferential Statistics**
- Makes predictions and inferences about populations based on sample data
- Tests hypotheses and confidence intervals
- Determines if patterns are statistically significant
- Techniques: hypothesis testing, regression analysis, confidence intervals
- Answers: "What does this sample tell us about the population?"

## Types of Statistics by Methodology

### **Parametric Statistics**
- Assumes data follows a specific distribution (usually normal)
- Uses population parameters (mean, standard deviation)
- More powerful when assumptions are met
- Examples: t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation

### **Non-Parametric Statistics**
- Makes no assumptions about data distribution
- Uses ranks and medians instead of means
- More flexible, works with smaller samples
- Examples: Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation

## Key Statistical Concepts

### **Population vs Sample**
- **Population**: Entire group of interest
- **Sample**: Subset of population used for analysis

### **Variables**
- **Quantitative**: Numerical data (height, age, income)
- **Qualitative**: Categorical data (color, gender, opinion)

### **Measurement Scales**
- **Nominal**: Categories without order (colors, brands)
- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (ratings, grades)
- **Interval**: Numeric with no true zero (temperature)
- **Ratio**: Numeric with true zero (height, weight)

### **Central Tendency**
- **Mean**: Average value
- **Median**: Middle value
- **Mode**: Most frequent value

### **Dispersion**
- **Range**: Difference between max and min
- **Variance**: Average squared deviation from mean
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Relative variability

### **Probability**
- Likelihood of an event occurring
- Range: 0 to 1 (0% to 100%)
- Foundation for inferential statistics
